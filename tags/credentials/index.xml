It’s hardly better to store static credentials in the .aws/credentials folder on a server or a local operator machine. As american cryptographer, writer, and computer security specialist, Bruce Schneier, says: . &amp;ldquo;Only amateurs attackWe machines; professionals target people.&amp;rdquo; Therefore, you, not your hardware, is at risk.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>By executing fraudulent software, cybercriminals can easily steal all the data from the folder or a whole directory with your, your friends’, and clients’ credentials. Even the AWS support team is exhausted with constant tickets regarding stolen credentials from public Git repos.

It means that you can’t get rid of the policy or destroy exposed credentials.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
