&lt;p>The recent AWS CloudDay Thailand at the Queen Sirikit National Convention Centre was an extraordinary convergence of tech aficionados. The sheer turnout—numbering in the thousands—made it clear: Security, efficiency, and cutting-edge technologies are at the forefront of every organization&amp;rsquo;s strategic plan.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Amid the vastness of the event, the Developer Lounge was a distinctive gem. Though smaller in scale, its value was undeniable, offering a blend of intimacy and innovation where in-depth discussions and exchanges thrived.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>AWS User Group Meetup: AWS Spot Pricing with Terraform</title><link>https://cageyv.dev/posts/speakup-aws-ec2-spot-in-bkk/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cageyv.dev/posts/speakup-aws-ec2-spot-in-bkk/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="event-review">

&lt;p>Set against the backdrop of the tech-forward AWS Office in Bangkok, the AWS User Group Meetup was a melting pot of innovation and collaboration. For CTOs and startup owners, understanding the pulse of the latest in cloud technology is crucial. This gathering provided a vibrant platform to explore, question, and share the most recent advancements in AWS.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>One of the prime concerns for any CTO or startup owner is maximizing efficiency without inflating costs. During the meetup, I delved into AWS Spot Pricing through Terraform, showcasing how organizations can achieve both. The Terraform Module for AWS Spot Instances isn&amp;rsquo;t just a tool; it&amp;rsquo;s a strategy. By automating Spot Max Prices management, it prevents potential budget overruns and unnecessary resource consumption – every DevOps professional&amp;rsquo;s dream.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Where no Windows Machine?

&lt;p>Usually, for PC gaming, it is required to have a nice and fresh PC. But time does not stand still; there are many things that change us. The simplest one is that our PCs just get old, and we can&amp;rsquo;t run new titles at high specs anymore, just because of hardware limitations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What&amp;rsquo;s next? If we are going to update our setup, this means a huge upfront cost. We have to pay right now or make a commitment to pay (such as credit) for a high-end PC. And you know what? After a while, it will get old too. I went through that cycle years ago, when I played a lot more than I do today. Every 2-3 years, I just needed to buy a new PC. At the same time, it is bad for the environment, because we just can&amp;rsquo;t make proper hardware utilization.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Book: Terraform Up and Running 3.0, Yevgeniy Brikman (2022)</title><link>https://cageyv.dev/posts/terraform-up-and-running/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cageyv.dev/posts/terraform-up-and-running/</guid><description/></item><item><title>What Is AWS CloudTrail, and Why Do You Need It</title><link>https://cageyv.dev/posts/aws-cloudtrail-to-slack/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cageyv.dev/posts/aws-cloudtrail-to-slack/</guid><description>&lt;p>Don’t have enough resources to set up a security department but want to stay on top of your AWS CloudTrail events?

&lt;p>While large corporations have their own Security Operations Centers (SOCs) responsible for information security and can afford expensive solutions, startups usually don’t have enough resources and time to set up such a luxury. Therefore, they have to look for simple security solutions to protect their data. Understanding the pain of limited resources, FivexL developed the Cloudtrail-to-Slack Terraform Module.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How To Save Resources With the Terraform Module for AWS Spot Instances</title><link>https://cageyv.dev/posts/aws-ec2-spot/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cageyv.dev/posts/aws-ec2-spot/</guid><description>&lt;p>Saving money on Amazon Web Services (AWS) Spot Instances can be a challenging task. Keep in mind that it is essentially an auction. Although prices don’t fluctuate as rapidly as on exchanges, they can still increase until they reach the on-demand rate. Sometimes it lasts for a day or two, but other times — up to several months, which can double the cost.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>How do you avoid a situation in which, for example, everything went perfect in November, but in December, the prices doubled amid the holiday hype — and you got not only an expensive system but also one with interruptions? Let&amp;rsquo;s examine why this happens. For this, let&amp;rsquo;s look at Spot Instance allocation strategies and see how you can use the Terraform module with no issues and save money at the same time.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
