&lt;p>At the recent AWS Meetup – DevTalk in Bangkok, I joined a group of cloud aficionados and professionals, representing a wide range of industries. Organized by the AWS User Group Thailand, this event underscored the importance of security in the AWS ecosystem—a critical concern for startups, seasoned businesses, and especially for leaders like CTOs and DevOps professionals.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The event was a resounding success, attracting a packed audience of 500 attendees who were eager to delve into the latest trends and insights in the world of AWS and cloud technologies. The event featured a series of talks by industry experts, including Werner Vogels, Donnie Prakoso, Vit Niennattrakul, Ankit Mehta, and myself. The event was a testament to the growing interest in cloud technologies and the need for a community-driven approach to knowledge-sharing.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>LProbe: A Secure, Open-Source Local Health Check Solution</title><link>https://cageyv.dev/posts/lprobe/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cageyv.dev/posts/lprobe/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="lprobe-a-one-stop-shop-tool-for-secure-local-health-checks">

&lt;p>Even if your app is functioning, that doesn’t always mean it’s working correctly. For you to securely and easily ensure your local container is healthy before the system fails, FivexL developed an open-source automated local health check solution - &lt;a href="https://github.com/fivexl/lprobe" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LProbe&lt;/a>.&lt;br>
A vivid example is an eternal timeout: your app doesn’t crash but keeps waiting for a system response. If you receive no alert that there is no response within, let’s say, 30 seconds, you may not notice something is wrong. Here comes a health check to ensure your app is working correctly.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Security Basics in AWS or How To Get Rid of Hardcoded Credential and Reduce Data Leakage Risks with aws-vault</title><link>https://cageyv.dev/posts/aws-vault/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cageyv.dev/posts/aws-vault/</guid><description>&lt;p>Developers often hardcode credentials on a public or private GitHub repository, ramping up data leakage risks. It’s hardly better to store static credentials in the .aws/credentials folder on a server or a local operator machine. As american cryptographer, writer, and computer security specialist, Bruce Schneier, says: . &amp;ldquo;Only amateurs attackWe machines; professionals target people.&amp;rdquo; Therefore, you, not your hardware, is at risk.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>By executing fraudulent software, cybercriminals can easily steal all the data from the folder or a whole directory with your, your friends’, and clients’ credentials. Even the AWS support team is exhausted with constant tickets regarding stolen credentials from public Git repos. Here&amp;rsquo;s why if you commit keys, expect an email in 3-5 minutes saying that the IAM policy has been applied. It means that you can’t get rid of the policy or destroy exposed credentials.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
