&lt;p>Set against the backdrop of the tech-forward AWS Office in Bangkok, the AWS User Group Meetup was a melting pot of innovation and collaboration. For CTOs and startup owners, understanding the pulse of the latest in cloud technology is crucial. This gathering provided a vibrant platform to explore, question, and share the most recent advancements in AWS.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>One of the prime concerns for any CTO or startup owner is maximizing efficiency without inflating costs. During the meetup, I delved into AWS Spot Pricing through Terraform, showcasing how organizations can achieve both. The Terraform Module for AWS Spot Instances isn&amp;rsquo;t just a tool; it&amp;rsquo;s a strategy. By automating Spot Max Prices management, it prevents potential budget overruns and unnecessary resource consumption – every DevOps professional&amp;rsquo;s dream.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Where no Windows Machine?

&lt;p>Usually, for PC gaming, it is required to have a nice and fresh PC. But time does not stand still; there are many things that change us. The simplest one is that our PCs just get old, and we can&amp;rsquo;t run new titles at high specs anymore, just because of hardware limitations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What&amp;rsquo;s next? If we are going to update our setup, this means a huge upfront cost. We have to pay right now or make a commitment to pay (such as credit) for a high-end PC. And you know what? After a while, it will get old too. I went through that cycle years ago, when I played a lot more than I do today. Every 2-3 years, I just needed to buy a new PC. At the same time, it is bad for the environment, because we just can&amp;rsquo;t make proper hardware utilization.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How To Save Resources With the Terraform Module for AWS Spot Instances</title><link>https://cageyv.dev/posts/aws-ec2-spot/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cageyv.dev/posts/aws-ec2-spot/</guid><description>&lt;p>Saving money on Amazon Web Services (AWS) Spot Instances can be a challenging task. Keep in mind that it is essentially an auction. Although prices don’t fluctuate as rapidly as on exchanges, they can still increase until they reach the on-demand rate. Sometimes it lasts for a day or two, but other times — up to several months, which can double the cost.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>How do you avoid a situation in which, for example, everything went perfect in November, but in December, the prices doubled amid the holiday hype — and you got not only an expensive system but also one with interruptions? Let&amp;rsquo;s examine why this happens. For this, let&amp;rsquo;s look at Spot Instance allocation strategies and see how you can use the Terraform module with no issues and save money at the same time.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
