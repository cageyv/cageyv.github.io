Introduction Link to heading In “The Myth of Sisyphus”, Albert Camus tackles life’s biggest question: What’s the point of it all?
His answer is simple and odd: there isn’t one — at least, not an essential or universal one.
Camus introduces the concept of the absurd: the connection between humanity’s never-ending search for meaning and the silence of the universe.
Instead of giving up, he argues for a more radical response — revolt.</description></item><item><title>Book: The 6 Types of Working Genius, Patrick M.

The 6 Types of Genius Link to heading #1 The Genius of Wonder refers to the ability to think deeply and ask questions about the world around us. It involves speculation and curiosity, and the desire to seek answers and take action. Those who possess this genius tend to naturally engage in these activities and find it easy to become absorbed in observing and questioning their surroundings, considering whether things could be different or if there is untapped potential.</description></item></channel></rss>
