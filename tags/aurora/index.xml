&lt;p>I was invited to the AWS User Group Singapore to talk about the PostgreSQL in AWS and about the Amazon Aurora DSQL. It was a great event. I was happy to meet many engineers and architects from the community. Usuage of the PostgreSQL in Singapore is quite huge, around half of audince was using it.
Organization of the event was perfect. I was happy to be a part of it.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
