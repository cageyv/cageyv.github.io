Remember that old project? The one where I spent time with Swift back in 2023, trying to build a simple game about work-life balance? It was an entertaining idea to demonstrate how easily things can go wrong when given only a few options. But like many side projects, it was abandoned because of time constraints and, to be honest, the lack of robust GenAI tools at the time."><meta name=keywords content="devops,k8s,aws,terraform,cloud,developer,personal"><meta name=twitter:card content="summary"><meta name=twitter:title content="Amazon Q CLI: More than chat.

<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h2><p>Remember that old project? The one where I spent time with Swift back in 2023, trying to build a simple game about work-life balance? It was an entertaining idea to demonstrate how easily things can go wrong when given only a few options. But like many side projects, it was abandoned because of time constraints and, to be honest, the lack of robust GenAI tools at the time.</p><p>Fast-forward to today. I decided to resurrect that concept, but with a twist. This time, I&rsquo;d leverage the power of Amazon Q CLI and aim for a Node.js/TypeScript implementation. Why the switch? Simplicity and the ease of deploying to the AWS cloud. My goal was a &ldquo;100% vibe coding experience&rdquo; – meaning, I&rsquo;d let Amazon Q do the heavy lifting. No manual code changes, just commands to Q.</p><p>I started by feeding Q the old Swift project and its notes, asking it to translate the game into JavaScript.</p><p><img src=/images/posts/aws_amazon_q_cli_game/001_swift.png alt="Initial Swift Project"></p><p>The initial results were impressive. Q managed to port the core logic to JavaScript. There are just maybe a few lines of code in that Swift Project, but Amazon Q able to understand the task and prepare a completely different application. This is not just a “standard” Java 8 to Java 18 upgrade. Here is a platform migration from macOS to Web Application.</p><p><img src=/images/posts/aws_amazon_q_cli_game/002_js.png alt="Q generates JavaScript code"></p><p>Next, I tasked Q with adding tests. It&rsquo;s crucial for Q to be able to run the code, identify issues, and fix them. I always recommend letting GenAI tools be able to test their code.</p><p><img src=/images/posts/aws_amazon_q_cli_game/003_tests.png alt="Q adding tests"></p><p>And here&rsquo;s the migration to JavaScript, completed by Amazon Q. It looks basic, but all the code was migration, and what is more important - project bootstrapping. I don&rsquo;t need to spend time preparing the development environment.</p><p><img src=/images/posts/aws_amazon_q_cli_game/004_compete_migration_to_js.png alt="JavaScript code by Q"></p><p>With the basic game ported, it was time for new features.</p><p><img src=/images/posts/aws_amazon_q_cli_game/005_addiding_new_features.png alt="Q adding new features"></p><h2 id=todomd-as-bidirectional-communication>ToDo.md as bidirectional communication
<a class=heading-link href=#todomd-as-bidirectional-communication><i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden=true title="Link to heading"></i>
<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h2><p>While Q was processing, I started a <code>todo.md</code> file to queue up more commands and ideas. AI can read files, right? All because of the built-in MCP inside the Q CLI.
Here we could find a set of basic tools: <a href=https://github.com/aws/amazon-q-developer-cli class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>https://github.com/aws/amazon-q-developer-cli/blob/main/crates/cli/src/cli/chat/tools/fs_read.rs</a><br>Oh, I maybe forgot, but yes, Amazon Q Developer CLI is open source.
Another critical part is the set of MCP servers, which, if you are interesting you could find <a href=https://github.com/awslabs/mcp/tree/main/src class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>here</a>.</p><p><img src=/images/posts/aws_amazon_q_cli_game/006_creating_todo_file.png alt="Creating a TODO file"></p><p>It is a bit better to tell Q CLI to use this <code>todo.md</code> file. It&rsquo;s hard for these tools to understand which content, for example, needs to be processed in the repository. The codebase could be big.</p><p><img src=/images/posts/aws_amazon_q_cli_game/007_ask_q_to_use_todo.png alt="Asking Q to use the TODO file"></p><p>Exciting &ldquo;Ah-ha&rdquo; moment, Q started proposing its ideas and adding them to the <code>todo.md</code> file. This created a cool back-and-forth communication channel, all within a simple markdown file. You know, currently we can&rsquo;t speak with the CLI Tool yet, but we can both read and write text files.</p><p><img src=/images/posts/aws_amazon_q_cli_game/008_q_use_todo_and_suggest_ideas.png alt="Q suggesting ideas in TODO file"></p><p>We even got checkboxes working in the to-do list, and Q was smart enough to understand them and mark items as done. This kind of interactive coding is quite something.</p><p><img src=/images/posts/aws_amazon_q_cli_game/009_add_check_boxes_for_todo.png alt="Q using checkboxes in TODO"></p><h2 id=deployment-to-aws-amplify>Deployment to AWS Amplify
<a class=heading-link href=#deployment-to-aws-amplify><i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden=true title="Link to heading"></i>
<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h2><p>With development progressing nicely, the next logical step was deployment. I decided to feign a bit of AWS unfamiliarity and asked Q for guidance on deploying the app.</p><p><img src=/images/posts/aws_amazon_q_cli_game/010_ask_q_how_to_deploy_app.png alt="Asking Q how to deploy"></p><p>Q suggested AWS Amplify, and the process was surprisingly straightforward. Connecting to GitHub was a breeze.</p><p><img src=/images/posts/aws_amazon_q_cli_game/011_amplify_connect_github.png alt="Amplify connect to GitHub"></p><p>Setting up the app basics in Amplify was also just a few clicks.</p><p><img src=/images/posts/aws_amazon_q_cli_game/012_amplify_app_basics.png alt="Amplify app basics"></p><p>And just like that, the app was deployed, complete with the new features. Amplify handled all the build processes, so no need for manual CI/CD setup.</p><p><img src=/images/posts/aws_amazon_q_cli_game/013_deployed_app_with_new_features.png alt="Deployed app with new features"></p><p>The most fascinating part? Even the commit messages were AI-generated!</p><p><img src=/images/posts/aws_amazon_q_cli_game/014_github_commits_from_ai.png alt="GitHub commits from AI"></p><p>This entire experience showcased that Amazon Q CLI is much more than just a chat interface. It can be a powerful partner in the development lifecycle, from coding and testing to deployment and even project management. It&rsquo;s a glimpse into a new era of software development.</p><p>The game itself is here: <a href=https://timetectonic.cageyv.dev/ class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>https://timetectonic.cageyv.dev/</a><br>My goal mostly was to try the autonomous behavior of Q and ability to follow instructions and perform not well described tasks.</p><h2 id=summary>Summary
