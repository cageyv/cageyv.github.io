&lt;p>I was invited to the AWS User Group Singapore to talk about the PostgreSQL in AWS and about the Amazon Aurora DSQL. It was a great event.

 &lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s assume that you already decided on PostgreSQL as your database. Why? Because it is a powerful, open-source object-relational database system with over 30 years of active development, correct? We will leave the problem of where and how to store data for another time.&lt;/p>

&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>If there are no specific requirements, we may select Aurora as the default option.
Storage systems are the key difference between the two. You don&amp;rsquo;t have to worry about being out of space. Aurora will help you. Aurora will automatically scale the storage up to 128 TB (November 2024). &amp;ldquo;The data is automatically replicated across Availability Zones, your data is highly durable with less possibility of data loss.&amp;rdquo; You can have one instance with data in 3 different places. If you want to add another region, it will give us six different places in the world where data is stored. Magic, right?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Book: The Myth of Sisyphus by Albert Camus: A Reflection on Absurdity (1955)</title><link>https://cageyv.dev/posts/the-myth-of-sisyphus/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cageyv.dev/posts/the-myth-of-sisyphus/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Myth-Sisyphus-Vintage-International-ebook/dp/B07HLQQZ3L" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.amazon.com/Myth-Sisyphus-Vintage-International-ebook/dp/B07HLQQZ3L&lt;/a>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In “The Myth of Sisyphus”, Albert Camus tackles life’s biggest question: &lt;strong>What’s the point of it all?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>His answer is simple and odd: &lt;strong>there isn’t one&lt;/strong> — at least, not an essential or universal one.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Camus introduces the concept of &lt;strong>the absurd&lt;/strong>: the connection between humanity’s never-ending search for meaning and the silence of the universe.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Instead of giving up, he argues for a more radical response — &lt;strong>revolt&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Getting started with Amazon Bedrock Studio</title><link>https://cageyv.dev/posts/speakup-aws-bedrock-and-accounts/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cageyv.dev/posts/speakup-aws-bedrock-and-accounts/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="aws-sumit-bangkok-2024">

&lt;p>Amazon Web Services (AWS) continually innovates to enhance user experience and efficiency. A prime example of this is the recent update to the RDS Data API, particularly for Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL-Compatible Edition. This update is a game-changer, as it offers users the ability to access Aurora clusters via a secure HTTP endpoint. The key here is the removal of rate limits and the elimination of the need for database drivers and managing connections.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Multiverse of Hosting a Static HTML File on AWS</title><link>https://cageyv.dev/posts/aws-static-hosting/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cageyv.dev/posts/aws-static-hosting/</guid><description>&lt;p>Today, we dive into the versatile and dynamic world of AWS, exploring the numerous avenues for hosting a simple, yet pivotal, web element - the static HTML file.

&lt;p>Even if your app is functioning, that doesn’t always mean it’s working correctly.

A vivid example is an eternal timeout: your app doesn’t crash but keeps waiting for a system response. If you receive no alert that there is no response within, let’s say, 30 seconds, you may not notice something is wrong. Here comes a health check to ensure your app is working correctly.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Where no Windows Machine? Luck of space? Travel a lot?

&lt;p>Usually, for PC gaming, it is required to have a nice and fresh PC. But time does not stand still; there are many things that change us. The simplest one is that our PCs just get old, and we can&amp;rsquo;t run new titles at high specs anymore, just because of hardware limitations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What&amp;rsquo;s next? If we are going to update our setup, this means a huge upfront cost. We have to pay right now or make a commitment to pay (such as credit) for a high-end PC. And you know what? After a while, it will get old too. I went through that cycle years ago, when I played a lot more than I do today. Every 2-3 years, I just needed to buy a new PC. At the same time, it is bad for the environment, because we just can&amp;rsquo;t make proper hardware utilization.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Book: The 6 Types of Working Genius, Patrick M.

I would go with the strategy of still creating an action plan, but calling it a yearly guess.
About company size, the book reminds us, that being small is not too bad.
Further in the book, we will talk about hiring, so here it’s more about the fact that an increase in the number of people does not always increase productivity in general.

It’s hardly better to store static credentials in the .aws/credentials folder on a server or a local operator machine. As american cryptographer, writer, and computer security specialist, Bruce Schneier, says: . &amp;ldquo;Only amateurs attackWe machines; professionals target people.&amp;rdquo; Therefore, you, not your hardware, is at risk.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>By executing fraudulent software, cybercriminals can easily steal all the data from the folder or a whole directory with your, your friends’, and clients’ credentials. Even the AWS support team is exhausted with constant tickets regarding stolen credentials from public Git repos. Here&amp;rsquo;s why if you commit keys, expect an email in 3-5 minutes saying that the IAM policy has been applied. It means that you can’t get rid of the policy or destroy exposed credentials.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>What Is AWS CloudTrail, and Why Do You Need It</title><link>https://cageyv.dev/posts/aws-cloudtrail-to-slack/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cageyv.dev/posts/aws-cloudtrail-to-slack/</guid><description>&lt;p>Don’t have enough resources to set up a security department but want to stay on top of your AWS CloudTrail events?
