Probably you already heard about AI and all the hype around it. \
I decide to use AI to automatically translate my blog post to other languages.\
First I try to translate my blog post to Thai. \
The goal here is to let people who don't speak English to read my blog and get some knowledge from it. \
Hope it will be useful.
