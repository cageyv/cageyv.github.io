## Event review

The recent AWS CloudDay Thailand at the Queen Sirikit National Convention Centre was an extraordinary convergence of tech aficionados. The sheer turnout—numbering in the thousands—made it clear: Security, efficiency, and cutting-edge technologies are at the forefront of every organization's strategic plan.

Amid the vastness of the event, the Developer Lounge was a distinctive gem. Though smaller in scale, its value was undeniable, offering a blend of intimacy and innovation where in-depth discussions and exchanges thrived.

## My Own Perspective
For CTOs, StartUp founders, and DevOps pros, navigating cross-account IAM access without compromising on security is a challenge. My presentation delved into this very issue, highlighting the potential of temporary elevated access and the AWS IAM Identity Center to bolster security stances.
The temporary elevated access approach, also known as just-in-time access, can simplify our operations and also make the life of the security team easier.

The Developer Lounge offered more than just a stage; it was a platform for enriching dialogue, fostering idea exchanges, and building mutual understanding. The audience's response was overwhelmingly positive, with many expressing interest in the topic and its potential applications.

## Future Endeavors

As someone entrenched in the dynamic world of tech, I'm excited about the future. The positive reception at the event underscores the urgency to streamline and secure our digital operations. And as cloud security morphs and evolves, I'm all in—ready to decode, share, and implement.

On the horizon? Singapore. I'm aspiring to be a speaker at an event. If someone invites me, I'll definitely be there. I'm also looking forward to sharing more insights and experiences through blog posts. My goal is to continue bridging the gap between cloud technology's potential and its strategic implementation.

## Conclusion

The AWS CloudDay Thailand was more than an event—it was a clear signal of where the tech world is headed. I'm honored to be a part of this trajectory, and even more driven to share, guide, and collaborate with fellow professionals. Whether it's IAM nuances or broader cloud strategies, together we're shaping the tech narrative.
